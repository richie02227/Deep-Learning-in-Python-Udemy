# Facial-Expression-Recognition

The data used is from kaggle link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

In this project, a logistic regression model is created from scratch and it is used to identify the facial expression in the given dataset of images.
The model uses sigmoid function and cross entropy function.
The weights and biases are trained using gradient descent.

All required functions are defined in util.py file. The project contains 4 different python files demontrating 4 different ways of classification.

ANN_softmax is a neural network with 1 hidden layer and uses softmax activation function in the output layer

ANN_sigmoid is a neural network with 1 hidden layer and uses sigmoid activation function in the output layer

logistic_softmax is a logistic regression model that is uses softmax activation function

logistic_sigmoid is a logistic regression model that is uses sigmoid activation function
