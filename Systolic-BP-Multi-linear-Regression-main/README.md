# Systolic-BP-Multi-linear-Regression

The dataset contains the following:
X1 --> Systolic blood pressure,
X2 --> Age of patients,
X3 --> Weight of patients

This is a simple implementation of multi-linear regression model to use only X2, only X3 and both X2 & X3 to predict the systolic blood pressure.
It is observed that the accuracy of the model is higher if both age and weight of patients is considered for prediction of systolic blood pressure.
The error function used is R-squared error.
