# E-Commerce-Project  
This project is part of Udemy course of Deep Learning.  
A dataset is given in the form of csv file which contains the data about what actions the user takes when they visit a shopping website. Depending on the actions the use has taken we train a model to predict whether the user bounces at the cart, adds to cart, begins checkout or finishes checkout.  
There are two models. One is trained using logistic regression and the other is trained using neural networks with hidden layers.
